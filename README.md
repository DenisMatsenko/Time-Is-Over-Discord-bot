# Time-Is-Over
I'm a discord bot and can help automate the economy, private rooms management, track members activity, members interactions and improve the communication experience on your discord server!!

This is my first discord bot that writes in js. Unfortunately, in the beginning it was supposed to be a small private bot, but a few of my friends asked me to add some new features to their Discord servers and at the end Time is over and it became a huge bot that can serve many servers. My only regret is that I didn't think about how big it could get, so the code is a bit confusing.
